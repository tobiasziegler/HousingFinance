# Australian Housing Finance Explorer

This is a Shiny app developed to complete the course project in Coursera's Developing Data Products, part of the [Data Science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science/1).

The app has been deployed to [my ShinyApps account](https://tobiasziegler.shinyapps.io/HousingFinance) for testing and assessment.

## Instructions

The charts show the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Housing Finance data, which estimate the monthly lending commitments made by financial institutions for housing.

The first chart shows lending for owner-occupied housing vs lending for investment properties (for rental or resale). The second shows more detailed breakdown, including construction of new dwellings, purchase of existing dwellings or refinancing of existing loans.

Use the controls in the app's sidebar to select a time range, data series and the type of display.
